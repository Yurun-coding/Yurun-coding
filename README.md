# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository serves as a showcase of the code I developed during my undergraduate studies in Materials Science and Engineering. 

I'm also planning to upload new projects and code as I continue to learn and work on exciting topic.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
